     here's how you create 5 
        or 50 
            or 500 
                or 5000 
                    or even 50000 
                        or more!

        a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, 
        but for a procedure to qualify as a function, 
        it should take some input and return an output 
        where there is some obvious relationship 
        between the input and the output."
